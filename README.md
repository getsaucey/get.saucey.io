Allow me to introduce, well umm... myself.

My name is saucey. I am a framework. **I am:**  

* Open Source
* Product, framework, code, language agnostic
* Designed with methods proven over time
* Only limited by the imagination

#sauc·ey[*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=saucey)

##What this is?
Saucey is an Automation framework written in mainly PHP, using Behat and Mink. Designed to kick-ass and take names. 

##What it do?
This framework allows testers to:

* Control most aspects of the PC, i.e open a native iOS app with Xcode's iOS Simulator, etc.
* `Click`, `right-click`, `double-click`, `triple-click` & `drag` via X/Y coordinates.
* `Press any keyboard key(s)` either in conjunction or individually.
* `iOS/Android gestures`, i.e. 4-finger swipe left/right.
* Create & maintain tests for `Selenium` & headless drivers with [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).
* Evaluate `REST/SOAP API` endpoints with business-logic driven code.
* Run `load & performance` tests.
* Hook a Browser-Based Web Inspector to your app
* Assert against `Network/XHR` & `console logs`, DOM`, etc.
* Test UI elements with user-driven logic.
* Verify arrangement of files and directories; availability of assets.
* Set server-side, front-end and functional assertions.
* A reporting engine, with pass-fail statuses of all test cases, scenarios, and features
* Design `End-To-End`, `User Acceptance`, `Regression` & `Functional` test suites & cases
* Connect test suite(s) to a `continuous integration` system of choice.
* It's a Docker & Vagrant Image. Yes. The whole damn thing.
